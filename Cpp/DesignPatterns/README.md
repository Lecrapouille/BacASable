# Design Patterns

My personal implementation of some design patterns because all examples I found on the internet do not address concrete cases.
For example:
- Model-View-Presenter is a pure Android design pattern and I could not find one nice and simple implementation in C++, GTKmm.
- Observer: nobody in blogs seems to care about the case where the Observer is destroyed before the Observable.
- Component: Implementation based on https://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/component.html
- Visitor pattern: ideal for visiting heterogeneous nodes without having to use dynamic_cast.
