# T-shape Piston game

Small game, generated by IA, where the player moves horizontally (left/right keys) and push vertically a piston (space key) in order to displace a cardboard. If the cardboard reaches the bottom or the top of the screen it is regenerated.

This game idea comes from a real robotic cells packaging cardboard, where I wanted to simulate it and the aim to validate the GRAFCET.

## Ubuntu/Debian

Needs SFML and box2d.

```bash
sudo apt-get install libsfml-dev libbox2d-dev
```

## Compilation

```bash
g++ -o piston_game main.cpp -lsfml-graphics -lsfml-window -lsfml-system -lbox2d
```
