Code based from the Youtube video "A Virtual World - JavaScript Course: Lesson 4 / 11 [Polygon Operations in JavaScript" by Radu Mariescu-Istodor https://youtu.be/3Aqe7Tv1jug?si=NN2ANPUDVZIJNs43 and code available at https://github.com/gniziemazity/virtual-world

Alternatively, a sweep-Line Algorithm for Line Segment Intersection https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkhUNzCGDt0
(known as Bentley-Ottmann algorithm https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bentley%E2%80%93Ottmann_algorithm) could be used.
For example: https://github.com/valenpe7/bentley-ottmann or https://github.com/the-hyp0cr1t3/sweepline-intersections
