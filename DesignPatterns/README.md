# Design Pattern

My personal implementation of some design patterns because all examples I found on internet do not respond to concrete cases.
For example:
- Model-View-Presenter is pure Android design pattern and I could not find one nice and simple implementation in C++, GTKmm.
- Observer nobody in blogs seems to care about the case where the Observer is destroyed before the Observable.
