# Pok√©dex

Simple database of Pokemons using FastAPI, SQLAlchemy and SQLite and display/interact with it in a web interface.

## FastAPI

FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python. It's designed to be easy to use and fast, while taking advantage of Python's type annotations. Here's an introduction to the main features of FastAPI:

## Installation

```bash
pip install uvicorn python3-uvicorn python3-fastapi python3-sqlalchemy
```

## Run

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

Where `main` is the name of the file containing the FastAPI application, and `app` is the name of the FastAPI instance.

Open your browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8000 to test.

## Automatic documentation

FastAPI generates two interactive documentation interfaces automatically:

- Swagger UI : http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs
- ReDoc : http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc
