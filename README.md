## MVC-MVP

Learning by myself how to implement a Model-View-Controller and a Model-View-Presenter. I'm not sure if the design is the correct one so take care ! In addition I just made the simplest model: a Student class with its a single member variable : its name.
* 01_MVP: 1st version of Model-View-Presenter: without observers. The model does not notify when its data has changed.
* 02_MVP: 2nd version of Model-View-Presenter: with observers. The model notifies when its data has changed. I think this design is less because in reality you do not want to desire to make you model observable.
