# BacASable

Share micro projects that I made for learning some techniques.

## AutoLoadLib

Interactive Programming in C: edit your C code at runtime, see your changes on your application without restarting it.
This allows to mimic the C langage as an interprete langage.

## Max-Plus

Defining a MaxPlus class in C++ and Julia:

## MVC-MVP

Learning how to implement a Model-View-Controller and a Model-View-Presenter in C++. I'm not sure if the design is the correct one so take care ! In addition I just made the simplest model: a Student class with its a single member variable : its name.
* 01_MVP: 1st version of Model-View-Presenter: without observers.
* 02_MVP: 2nd version of Model-View-Presenter: with observers.
* 03_MVC: Model-View-Controller based on http://www.laputan.org/pub/papers/POSA-MVC.pdf
