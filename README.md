# BacASable

Sharing my proof of concepts that I made for learning some techniques that can be used
in my bigger projects. This is kind of GitHub GISTs but grouped in a single repository (sandbox
means "bac à sable" in French).

Mainly C++ code but also Julia, Forth, Prolog, Scilab, GTK+ and C code, some related to C++.

## Bash

Quick bash scripts for automation:
- **backup-github.sh**: Script for backing up my GitHub projects to a specified directory.

## Ansible

Automation examples using Ansible:
- **Hello World**: Basic Ansible playbook demonstrating directory creation, file copying, and script execution.

## C code

### AutoLoadLib

Interactive Programming in C: edit your C code at runtime, see your changes in
your application without restarting it. This allows mimicking the C language as
an interpreted language.

## C++

### Forth Wrapper

Proof of concept implementing an ultra-basic Forth interpreter wrapping C++ APIs.
Two examples are provided:
- **CppPhysicsEngine**: Wrapping a thin C++ abstraction library integrating the physics engine Bullet and
the 3D library OpenSceneGraph.
- **CppSymbolicEngine**: Wrapping a C++ symbolic library (Ginac) for symbolic mathematics.

### Design Patterns

Implementation of various design patterns: Visitor, Observer, MVP, Component, Command, etc.

#### Visitor

Iterate over a collection of class instances with different APIs and call the
correct methods. Ideal for game scene graphs.

#### Component

Composition is better than inheritance. Similar to the Strategy pattern, but Component is
used for completing the state of the instance instead of adding dynamic behavior.

#### Observer

Safe observer pattern managing the case where the Observer can be destroyed before the
Observable. Includes examples using libsigc++.

Note: Personally I would use [libsigc++](https://developer.gnome.org/libsigc++-tutorial/stable/index.html)
instead of implementing my own Observer/Listener class. This lib allows you to
add signals/slots (similarly to Qt). I give an example of this lib.

#### MVC-MVP

Learning how to implement the Model-View-Controller (MVC) and
Model-View-Presenter (MVP) design patterns in C++, first with console applications then with GTK+.
Minimalist examples are provided.

### Unit Tests

Having fun mocking C functions such as open(), read() to unit test C functions calling them.
We exploit the behavior of weak symbols by creating mock functions and defining C++ mock classes
to use them easily with Google Test/Mock. See the README in this folder for more details.

### Symbolic Manipulation

Basic symbolic manipulation in C++ using libraries like GINaC and SymEngine for computer algebra operations.

### Runtime Polymorphism

Based on the YouTube video "Better Code: Runtime Polymorphism" by Sean Parent.
https://sean-parent.stlab.cc/papers-and-presentations/#better-code-runtime-polymorphism

Examples demonstrating type-erased polymorphism using std::function and smart pointers.

### ConditionVariable

Testing a basic wrapper for notifications through condition variables in multi-threaded applications.

### Union

Testing union structures for a Forth project https://github.com/Lecrapouille/SimForth. Instead of manipulating two separate stacks (integer and float), use a single one and make operators change the type similar to OCaml operators `+` and `+.`, `int_of_float`.

### C# Properties

Mimicking C# properties in C++ using getter/setter patterns.

### Containers

Prototype data structures such as graphs and scene graphs for game development.

### Policies

C++ policy templates for iterating over folders and extracting desired files using template metaprogramming.

## Game Engine

Learning how to program in Godot, Unity, and SFML:
- **Godot**: Orbital camera controller implementation, ported from Unity.
- **Unity**: Transform experiments with local vs world position/rotation.
- **SFML**: Road junction algorithms for SimCity-like games, including segment intersection and border detection.

## Gedit

### Syntax highlighting

Some *.lang files for my personal projects inspired by https://artisan.karma-lab.net/faire-todo-lists-gedit
- **logs**: For highlighting log files generated by my personal projects (SimTaDyn, etc.)
- **forth**: (TODO) For highlighting my SimForth scripts (a personal Forth slightly modified)

## GTK+

### GTK+2 with GTK-server

Bash scripts to launch GTK+2 applications with GTK-server https://www.gtk-server.org/. Initial step before porting to Forth applications. Examples include drawing areas and image display using FIFO and TCP communication.

### Design Patterns

Model-View-Presenter (MVP) implementation in GTKmm (C++ wrapper for GTK+). See the Cpp/DesignPatterns/MVC-MVP folder for more details.

## Julia

### Call C/C++ code

Examples showing how to call C functions from Julia, including structure passing and array manipulation.

### JuliaCpp

Integration examples for calling C++ code from Julia.

### Max-Plus algebra

Max-Plus algebra implementation in Julia. See the MaxPlus section for more details.

### Standalone

Learning how to create standalone Julia applications that can be distributed as executables.

## Max-Plus

Defining Max-Plus classes in C++ and Julia for Max-Plus algebra operations.
More information about this algebra: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max-plus_algebra
My port to Julia of the Max-Plus Scilab toolbox: https://github.com/Lecrapouille/MaxPlus.jl

## MyMakefile

Template Makefile helper with common build targets and utilities for C/C++ projects.

## OpenCV in C++

Testing various OpenCV functionalities:
- **BasicFunctions**: Basic OpenCV operations and image processing
- **CameraSettings**: Camera intrinsic and extrinsic calibration
- **CarCounting**: Vehicle counting using background subtraction
- **Franchissement**: Highway lane detection and crossing detection
- **OrientedROI**: Region of Interest extraction from oriented rectangles
- **ParkingLots**: Parking lot detection algorithms

## Prolog

Learning Prolog programming and how to call Prolog from C++ code. Implementing basic Prolog routines based
on graph theory that could be used in my personal project SimTaDyn instead of heavy C++ classes and code.
Includes examples for path finding, cycle detection, and reachability analysis.

## Law Control

### ScicosLab / NSP (Scilab) blocks

Some "as-is" very old and unmaintained C code for ScicosLab: joystick, camera, UART.
http://www.scicoslab.org/

### Plant Growth

A student project for generating 3D plants made many years ago using [NSP](https://cermics.enpc.fr/~jpc/nsp-tiddly/mine.html) or [ScicosLab](http://www.scicoslab.org/). Note: ScicosLab is a fork of Scilab (the equivalent of Matlab) and NSP has been replaced. This is not a serious application. If you are interested in simulation of plant growth, read:
